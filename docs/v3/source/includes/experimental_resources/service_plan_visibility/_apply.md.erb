This endpoint applies a Service Plan Visibility. It behaves similar to the [PATCH Service Plan Visibility endpoint](#update-a-service-plan-visibility) but this endpoint will append to the existing list of organizations when the Service Plan is `organization` visible.

#### Definition
`POST /v3/service_plans/[guid]/visibility`

#### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
